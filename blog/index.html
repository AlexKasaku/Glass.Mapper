<p>
    Copy and paste this page, for some reason this is the only file that Jekyll will build. I am assuming that there is some encoding problem caused by VS

{% for post in site.posts %}
      <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }} + {{forloop.index}}</a></li>

{% endfor %}
