<h2>Stable</h2>
<p>
    Stable releases of Glass.Mapper are available from <a href="https://nuget.org/packages?q=Glass.Mapper">Nuget.org</a>. 
</p>
<h2>Pre-Releases</h2>
<p>
    You can download the pre-releases of Glass.Mapper from our own build server by setting up a custom
    package source for Nuget in Visual Studio:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>http://build.glass.oss.eduservlab.net/guestAuth/app/nuget/v1/FeedService.svc/</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Pre-release versions are build every night by our nightly build assuming we have changed some code in the source.
</p>
<p>
    Our build server has been kindly hosted by <a href="http://www.eduserv.org.uk">Eduserv</a>.

    <li>Select the next option down Package Sources. You should see on the right hand side under Available Package 
        Sources the Nuget Official package source.</li>
    <li>Click the plus symbol in the top right of the screen, this should add a package source.</li>
    <li>Select the new source and in the Name box at the bottom of the window enter Glass Build Server.</li>
