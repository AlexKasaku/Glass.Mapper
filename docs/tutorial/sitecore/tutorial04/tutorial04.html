    <h1>Tutorial 4 - Complex field types <small> </small></h1>
</div>
<p>
    In this tutorial we will look at the more complex field types, we will look at how we can use a Tree List and 
    and Image field. 
</p>
<p>
    We are going to update our home page to contain a list of featured news articles. Beneath the news item I have create a 
    few news articles:
</p>
<img src="tutorial04.newsitems.PNG"/>
<p>
    A news article has the following fields:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abstract - Single Line Text</li>
    <li>Page Title - Single Line Text</li>
    <li>FeaturedImage - Image</li>
    <li>Date - Date</li>
    <li>Main Body - Rich Text</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The model for out News Article looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial04/tutorial04.newsarticle.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    Notice that for the FeaturedImage field we use the a special Glass.Mapper type <strong>Glass.Mapper.Sc.Fields.Image</strong>. There 
    are variety of different field types for handling the more complex field types in the <strong>Glass.Mapper.Sc.Fields</strong> namespace.
</p>
<p>The configuration for the news article is straight forward:</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial04/tutorial04.newsarticleconfig.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    We now need to update the home page to have the additonal featured news field:
</p>
<img src="tutorial04.homefield.PNG"/>
<p>
    Now we need to update our home page model to contain a property that can contain a list of news articles:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial04/tutorial04.homepage.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    Finally we have to update our config to map the new field:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial04/tutorial04.homepageconfig.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    Notice that to map a tree list we just made a property that contains the type we want to load the target items as
    and simply update the configuration.
</p>
<p>All that remains to be done is updating the ASCX page to render out the selected news articles:</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial04/tutorial04.homepage.ascx" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    If we compile and run the website we should see that our featured articles and images render nicely below the hero unit:
</p>
<img src="tutorial04.webpage.PNG"/>
<p>
    That completes this tutorial, you have seen how you can use an image field and also load items linked via fields.
