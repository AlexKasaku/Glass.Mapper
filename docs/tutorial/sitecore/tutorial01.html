    This tutorial will take you through how to setup Glass.Mapper to work with Sitecore.
</p>

<p>
    The first task when using Glass is to configure your model classes so they can be used by Glass.Mapper. You have
    two options for configuring your class class, either fluent or attributed, you can read more about these in the 
    <a href="/Glass.Mapper/docs/concepts/index.html">Concepts</a> section. For this demo we will be using fleunt configuration.
</p>

<p>
    Start by having the following very simple item in Sitecore:
</p>
<img src="/Glass.Mapper/docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial01.item.png"/>
<p>
    The model will have a single property for the title field and then two more properties for
    the ID and the URL of the item:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="Sites/Sitecore/Glass.Mapper.Sites.Sc/Tutorial1/Model/DemoClass.cs" ref="develop">

</pre>

<p>
    To mark this class up create a fluent configuration class:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="Sites/Sitecore/Glass.Mapper.Sites.Sc/Tutorial1/Config/Tutorial1Config.cs" ref="develop">

</pre>

<p>
    Now instruct Glass.Mapper to load this configuration, do this in the Application_Start method of the Global.ascx:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial01.global.cs" ref="gh-pages">

</pre>

<p>
    Now that the model is mapped and ready to use with Glass.Mapper we need to create a sublayout. A sublayout has been 
    created in Sitecore and assigned to the Tutorial1 item. Using the SitecoreContext class we can request the current item
    as the type of DemoClass in the code behind file:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="Sites/Sitecore/Glass.Mapper.Sites.Sc/Tutorial1/Layouts/Tutorial1Sublayout.ascx.cs" ref="develop">

</pre>
<p>
    In the ascx page place the following:
</p>
<pre class="github html" file="Sites/Sitecore/Glass.Mapper.Sites.Sc/Tutorial1/Layouts/Tutorial1Sublayout.ascx" ref="develop">

</pre>

<p>
    Compile the application and navigate to the Sitecore item, you should see the page render similar to below:
</p>
<img src="tutorial01.webpage.png"/>

<p>
    This tutorial has show you how to mark up a class for use with Glass.Mapper, how to retrieve the current item and
    render it to screen.
