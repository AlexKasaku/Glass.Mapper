<p>
    This tutorial will take you through how to setup Glass.Mapper to work with Sitecore.
</p>

<p>
    The first task when using Glass is to configure your model classes so they can be used by Glass.Mapper. You have
    two options for configuring your class class, either fluent or attributed, you can read more about these in the 
    <a href="/Glass.Mapper/docs/concepts/index.html">Concepts</a> section. For this demo we will be using fleunt configuration.
</p>

<p>
    We start by having the following very simple item in Sitecore:
</p>
<img src="/Glass.Mapper/docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial01.item.png"/>
<p>
    Our model will have a single property for the title field and then two more properties for
    the ID and the URL of the item:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="Sites/Sitecore/Glass.Mapper.Sites.Sc/Tutorial1/Model/DemoClass.cs" ref="develop">

</pre>

<p>
    To mark this class up we create a fluent configuration class:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="Sites/Sitecore/Glass.Mapper.Sites.Sc/Tutorial1/Config/FluentConfig.cs" ref="develop">

</pre>

<p>
    We next have to tell Glass.Mapper to load this configuration, we do this in the Application_Start method fo the Global.ascx:
