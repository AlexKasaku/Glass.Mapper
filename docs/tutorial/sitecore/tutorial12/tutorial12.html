<p>
    It is possible to get Glass.Mapper to generate the models used by Sitecore MVC.
</p>
<p>
    Models used by Sitecore MVC are generated by the mvc.getModel pipeline. When you installed Glass.Mapper.Sc 
    a config file called Glass.Mapper.Sc.Mvc.config was inserted into the /App_Config/Include directory, this config
    file creates an additional processor to the mvc.getModel pipeline to create models from Glass. 
</p>
<p>
    For this tutorial I have assumed you have already setup Sitecore to use MVC. We are going to create
    a new device that allows us to output the news articles as XML so that other service can consume and present
    the news articles on another site.
</p>
<p>
    In Sitecore I have defined the following ViewRendering:
</p>
<img src="tutorial12.newslandingxml.PNG"/>
<p>
    I have specified the NewsLanding model created in <a href="../tutorial07/tutorial07.html">Tutorial 7</a>. 
    The mark-up for the CSHTML page is very simple:
</p>
<pre class="github xml" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial12/tutorial12.newslandingxml.cshtml" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    If we navigate to the news landing page setting the device to XML we get a very simple XML rendering of our 
    news items:
</p>
<pre class="github xml" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial12/tutorial12.newslanding.xml" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    You can see from this tutorial that we don't actually have to do anything to get our Glass.Mapper models
    working with Sitecore MVC.
