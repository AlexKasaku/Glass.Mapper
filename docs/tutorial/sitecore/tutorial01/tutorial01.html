    This series of tutorials will take you through the process of building a simple site using Glass.Mapper. When you have
    completed all the tutorials you will have a simple Sitecore site and also have covered the majority of features in 
    Glass.Mapper.
</p>
<p>
    For this tutorial we will be using many common open source projects to help us build the site, these are listed below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/davidebbo/WebActivator">WebActivator</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://docs.castleproject.org/Windsor.MainPage.ashx">Castle Windsor</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Having a knowledge of these projects is advantageous but not required to complete all the tutorials. You can also swap out
    that Castle Windsor project for your favourite dependency injection framework.
</p>
<p>
    You can find the complete source for the site in the <a href="https://github.com/mikeedwards83/Glass.Mapper/tree/develop/Sites/Sitecore">Github repo</a>:
</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
    You first task will be to download Glass.Mapper.Sc from Nuget. If you open the Nuget package manager and search for Glass.Mapper.Sc you will see
    a large selection of different projects:
</p>
<img src="tutorial01.nugetsearch.png"/>
<p>
    The two we will focus on is Glass.Mapper.Sc and Glass.Mapper.Sc.CastleWindsor, the first project (Glass.Mapper.Sc) is the basic project
    that doesn't include any dependency injection framework. If you want to use this project you will need to integrate your favourite dependency
    injection framework to get this working. For this demo we are going to use the Glass.Mapper.Sc.CastleWindsor project, this has the popular
    Castle Windsor dependency injection framework already configured and ready for you to go.
</p>
<p>
    Click the Install button for Glass.Mapper.Sc.CastleWindsor.
</p>
<p>
    When the solution install several items are downloaded, most of these are dependencies but one additional item that gets download is a file 
    inserted in to the App_Start folder: 
</p>
<img src="tutorial01.appstart.PNG"/>
<p>
    This file is used by WebActivator to load Glass.Mapper.Sc when the application starts. I won't go into how WebActivator works but I will discuss
    the code in the file works. If you open the file you should see code similar to that below but with your namespaces:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial01/tutorial01.app_start.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    This code sets up the dependency resolver we want to use, in this tutorial we are using Castle Windsor. We then create a Glass.Mapper Context, 
    the context stores all the configuration we need for Glass.Mapper to run. Further down we can see an attribute loader, this will scan
    the current assembly for any models that have been marked up with attributes (but more on that later). Finally we pass the attribute loader
    to our context to so that the context can load all the required models.
</p>
<p>
    Don't worry if this doesn't all make sense straight away, as you go through the tutorials it will all be come clear. With a single click on Nuget 
    we have installed and setup everything we need to get Glass.Mapper.Sc working.
