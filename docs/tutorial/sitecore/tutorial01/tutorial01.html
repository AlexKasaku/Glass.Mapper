    This series of tutorials will take you through the process of building a simple site using Glass.Mapper. When you have
    completed all the tutorials you will have a simple Sitecore site and also have covered the majority of features in 
    Glass.Mapper.
</p>
<p>
    For this tutorial we will be using many common open source projects to help us build the site, these are listed below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Having a knowledge of these projects is advantagous but not required to complete all the tutorials. 
    
</p>
<p>
    You can find the completesource for the site in the <a href="https://github.com/mikeedwards83/Glass.Mapper/tree/develop/Sites/Sitecore">Github repo</a>:
