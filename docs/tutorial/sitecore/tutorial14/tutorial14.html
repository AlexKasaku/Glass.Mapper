title: Tutorial 14 - MVC Page Editor Support

{% include pageheader.html %}
<p>
    This tutorial will look at the MVC page editor support, Glass supports both editable fields
    and edit frames in MVC.
</p>
<p>
    For this tutorial I will have a single page that lists blog posts, I want to be
    able to edit each blog post in the page as well as us an edit frame to edit the associated 
    item.
</p>
<p>
    For this solution I have to very simple models to represent the landing page and the blog
    post:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial14/tutorial14.bloglanding.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial14/tutorial14.blogpost.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    The HTML for the MVC rendering looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial14/tutorial14.bloglanding.cshtml" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    The first thing to note about the above layout is that it inherits from the <strong>Glass.Mapper.Sc.Web.Mvc.GlassView</strong>
    class. This class exposes the additional methods to support editable fields and edit frames. On the page it looks like
    this:
</p>
<img src="tutorial14.webpage.png" class="img-polaroid"/>
<p>
    To make a field editable you can use the Editable method in the same way you would with a
    sublayout:
</p>
<pre class="cs">
    &lt;h3&gt;@Editable(post, x => x.Title)&lt;/h3&gt;
</pre>
<p>
    To use an edit frame use a using statement and call the BeginEditFrame method:
</p>
<pre class="cs">
            @using (BeginEditFrame(post.Path))
            {
                &lt;h3&gt;@Editable(post, x => x.Title)&lt;/h3&gt;
                @Editable(post, x => x.MainBody)
            }
</pre>
<p>
    When using Edit Frame you can specify the data source of the item you want to load into the 
    Edit Frame and also the Path of the buttons to display.
</p>
<p>
    There are also some additional helpers that extend the standard HtmlHelper function, these can be found 
    in the namespace <a href="https://github.com/mikeedwards83/Glass.Mapper/blob/master/Source/Glass.Mapper.Sc/Web/Mvc/HtmlHelperExtensions.cs">Glass.Mapper.Sc.Web.Mvc</a>.
