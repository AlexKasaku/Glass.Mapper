    In this tutorial we will look at how we can configure our classes to use inheritance using fluent configuration. It is 
    important to note that attribute configuration works differently which we will cover in a later tutorial.
</p>
<p>
    When you start to build you models you will want to group common properties in to a base class and make you other models 
    inherit from it. For example in our simple solution most of our models use the "Page Title" field and have the items
    URL and ID. We can extract this into a separate class:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial06/tutorial06.contentbase.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    We slightly change how we define the configuration for this class, instead we create a static property that will return
    the configuration, the reason for this will be come clear further down:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial06/tutorial06.contentbase.config.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    Now that we have the base type defined we can update the NewsArticle class to inherit from it, and remove the properties 
    that now exist on the base type:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial06/tutorial06.newsarticle.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    We then update the NewsArticle configuration to import the ContentBase configuration by referencing the static property we
    wrote earlier:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial06/tutorial06.newsarticle.config.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    Notice that we have now simplified the NewsArticle configuration so that it only defines the properties that exist on the
    NewsArticle class itself.
</p>

<p>
    This completes the this tutorial, we have seen how we can restructure our code to use inheritance and setup the configuration 
    to import the different types.
