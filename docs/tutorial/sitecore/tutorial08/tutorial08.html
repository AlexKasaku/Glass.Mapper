<p>
    In this tutorial we will look at how we can use attribute configuration. So far in the tutorials we have used fluent configuration
    but this isn't for everyone.
</p>
<p>
    For this demo we will be creating the events area of our website.
</p>
<p>
    Our event model is shown below, every class that you want to use with attribute configuration must have the SitecoreTypeAttribute defined
    on the class. There is an attribute that pairs with the fleunt methods, everything you can do with fluent configuration you can do 
    with attribute configuration, it is just a choice of style. 
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial08/tutorial08.event.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    Now we have our configured class we need to tell Glass.Mapper to load the configuration, this is done using the SitecoreAttributeConfigurationLoader 
    and updating our Application_Start method in the Global class. The loader takes a list of assemblies to load types from, it will search 
    through the assemblies you have listed and load any classes that have the SitecoreTypeAttribute:

<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial08/tutorial08.global.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    After configuring your classes there isn't and different in how you use Glass.Mapper, navigate to GitHub to get the code
    for the event sublayout and event landing page.
