<p>
    The SitecoreService class represents the Sitecore.Data.Database class and allows you to get items out of Sitecore.
</p>
<p>
    The SitecoreContext class is the equivalent of accessing items via the Sitecore.Context namespace. It has a variety of 
    methods for getting the current item plus the site root. It also inherits from the SitecoreService class so that you 
    can access and request items from the database in Sitecore.Context.Database.
</p>
<p>
    In this tutorial we will use the two services to create a comments control that allows a site user to create a comment
    that is added to the Sitecore database. First lets define our two models, the first model represents that page that the
    comments will be added to and could represent any item in our solution. The second class is the comment itself that will
    be saved back to Sitecore:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial11/tutorial11.CommentPage.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial11/tutorial11.Comment.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    Now that we have or model lets layout the page, I have used a mixture of WebControls and inline statements to create
    the forms and comments rendering: 
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial11/tutorial11.CommentSublayout.ascx" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    The code behind for our comment sublayout looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial11/tutorial11.CommentSublayout.ascx.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    The UserControl still inherits from the GlassUserControl so we still specify the model type we want loaded, this allows
    the UserControl to do most of the work.
</p>
<p>
    Within the the click event we create an instance of the SitecoreContext and SitecoreService classes. Notice that the 
    SitecoreService class takes the name of the database we want to save items to.
    The SitecoreContext class allows use to grab the current page as a CommentPage type. We could use the Model property but 
    I wanted to show how you could use the SitecoreContext class. 
</p>
<p>
    We then map the data from the form into a the Comment class. It is important to note that the Name property will be used
    by Glass.Mapper as the Sitecore item name so we need to ensure that name is something Sitecore friendly.
</p>
<p>
    Next we save the comment to the master database, Glass.Mapper doesn't bypass the security settings in Sitecore so you either
    have to disable the security or ensure you have the correct Create permissions assigned. It is important
    that the parent item type (the CommentPage type) has a property that represents the items Id, if you want to save
    the item as a specific language you also need to ensure that the parent as the a property to represent the language.
