<p>
    In this tutorial we will create a simple home page with a title and rich text content.
</p>
<p>
    The home page item is very simple at the moment and only contains two fields:
</p>
<img src="tutorial02.fields.png" class="img-polaroid"/>
<p>
    First we need to create the model that will represent our home page item:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial02/tutorial02.homepage.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    This class is very simple class but notice that the properties use the keyword virtual. We will explain why this is needed
    later but it shouldn't affect your code.
</p>
<p>
    For this demo we are going to use the attribute configuration however if you prefer you can use fluent configuration (we will 
    look at this later). The code below shows how you can configure the two fields, we have set the class to AutoMap. AutoMapping
    will treat every property as a field or item metadata (e.g. if you have property called Url it will be populated with the items URL).
    To use AutoMapping you field name must match the name of your property.
</p>
<p>
    Now that we have our model we can turn our attention to the home page sublayout. In the code 
    behind we place the following code:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial02/tutorial02.homepage.ascx.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    Here you can see that we have created an instance of SitecoreContext, this gives you access to the current Sitecore context 
    via Glass.Mapper. The second line then loads the current context item into the HomePage class.
</p>
<p>
    Finally we have the HTML output:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial02/tutorial02.homepage.ascx" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    Hit F5 and load the homepage and you should see the two fields rendered to screen:
</p>
<img src="tutorial02.webpage.png" class="img-polaroid"/>
<p>
    That ends the first tutorial, you have seen how to configure a simple class with fields and render them to screen.
