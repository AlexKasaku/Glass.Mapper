<p>
    In this tutorial we will create a simple home page with a title and rich text content.
</p>
<p>
    The home page item is very simple at the moment and only contains two fields:
</p>
<img src="tutorial02.fields.png" class="img-polaroid"/>
<p>
    First we need to create the model that will represent our home page item:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial02/tutorial02.homepage.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    This class is very simple class but notice that the properties use the keyword virtual, this is important to allow
    Glass to lazy load you classes later on. You will also notice that we haven't added any other markup to our class, Glass.Mapper
    can automatically infer what data to load for you using <a href="/2013/03/24/OnDemandMapping.html">OnDemand Mapping</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Now that we have our model we can turn our attention to the home page sublayout. In the code 
    behind we place the following code:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial02/tutorial02.homepage.ascx.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    Here you can see that we have created an instance of SitecoreContext, this gives you access to the current Sitecore context 
    via Glass.Mapper. The second line then loads the current context item into the HomePage class.
</p>
<p>
    Finally we have the ASCX HTML, you will notice that I have used inline statements to render the data, you can use 
    ASP.NET Web Controls if you wish.
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial02/tutorial02.homepage.ascx" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    Hit F5 and load the homepage and you should see the two fields rendered to screen:
</p>
<img src="tutorial02.webpage.png" class="img-polaroid"/>
<p>
    That ends the first tutorial, you have seen how to configure a simple class with fields and render them to screen.
