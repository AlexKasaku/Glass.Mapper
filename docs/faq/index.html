        I have added the binary file to the "Depends" directory but they still show as an error in Visual Studio
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Make sure you have downloaded the correct version of Sitecore (see <a href="/docs/dependencies.html">Glass Dependencies</a> for the current version in use)
        and that you have copied both the "bin" and "bin_Net4" directories form the website root.  These directories need to exist in the "Depends" directory for Visual Studio to reference them correctly.

        My build is failing with an error like
        [Error	200	Unable to copy file "xxxx" to "xxxx". Could not find a part of the path 'xxx'.	C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\HedgehogDevelopment\SitecoreProject\v9.0\HedgehogDevelopment.SitecoreProject.targets	189	6	xxxx]
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This is due to TDS not being configured for your sites location on disk.  Go to the Solution explorer and edit the TDS projects

            <img src="images/TDSProjectConfigurationOption.png"/>
            <br/>
            Click the Build option and edit the "Sitecore Deploy Folder".  This needs to point to the site of your disk.

        <p>
            I like to have my own build configuration so you don't need to touch the default one.

            Can download a 30 day trial form the <a href="http://www.hhogdev.com/Products/Team-Development-for-Sitecore/Overview.aspx">Hedgehog Development</a> site.  
            Otherwise contact up on the <a href="/googlegroup.html"> Google Group </a> and someone will get a package to you.

            You don't need the items to build the core of the solution so you can just unload the following project
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Glass.Mapper.Sc.Integration.Tds
            </li>
            <li>
                Glass.Mapper.Sc.Razor.Tds

        <p>
            If you are implementing for another CMS or working on the existing Umbraco implementation all you need to do is unload the following projects.
            It also might be a good idea to create a new solution file with only the projects you are working on, be careful that you don't miss out on any new projects that could be added by someone else

        I get the Could not copy the file "xxx\license.xml" because it was not found.	Glass.Mapper.Sc.Integration

        You need to copy your license.xml to the data directory of the Integration tests

        enable <a href ="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/using-nuget-without-committing-packages">package restore</a> on the solution an NuGet will work it all out for you.

    <dd>
        There is any number of reasons why the test might fail.  Here is a list of things to try before contacting us
        <ul>
            <li>
                Have you synced up the TDS projects?
            </li>
            <li>
                Can you access the glass test site?
            </li>
            <li>
                Are the TDS projects set up correctly?
            </li>
