    <dt>I have added the binary file to the "Depends" directory but they still show as an error in Visual Studio</dt>
    <dd>
        Make sure you have downloaded the correct version of Sitecore (see <a href="../dependencies.html">Glass Dependencies</a>< for the current version in use)
        and that you have copied the "bin" and "bin_Net4" directories form the website root.  These directories need to exist in the "Depends" directory for Visual Studio to reference them correctly.
