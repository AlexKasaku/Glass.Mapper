    <h1>I used Glass.Sitecore.Mapper <small>- What has changed?</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
    For those who have used Glass.Sitecore.Mapper the biggest question is going to be what has changed, this page attempts
    to detail all the new features:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>
        Abstractions
    </dt>
    <dd>
        To make Glass.Mapper a platform that could be used across multiple CMS's we have had to abstract a lot of the 
        logic. This means that when you create for example a data mapper you will want to cast the configuration or context
        to the CMS specific version.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Multiple Assemblies
    </dt>
    <dd>
        There are now multiple assemblies for Glass.Mapper. The Glass.Mapper assembly contains the generic mapping code
        and the Glass.Mapper.Sc contains the Sitecore specific implementations. You will need to include both in your project.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        SitecoreClass -> SitecoreType
    </dt>
    <dd>
        The type SitecoreClass as now been renamed SitecoreType, we made this change because you can map more
        than just classes with Glass.Mapper.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        More Unit Tests
    </dt>
    <dd>
        We have added more unit tests and organised them in a more controlled and logic manner.
