<h2>Copyright Scripts</h2>
<p>
    This sections details the different copyright scripts in the solution. Each script allows you to apply
    the Apache 2 license to the top of the files in the solution. The scripts should be run from the PowerShell 
    console from the directory containing the scripts. When running the scripts it is best to close Visual Studio,
    sometimes running the scripts with Visual Studio open will corrupt the file due to competing file locks.
</p>

<p>
    You can read more about the Apache 2 boiler plate on the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html#apply">Apache 2 License Page</a>

    and are used by the script to work out which content to replace.
</p>
<p>The <strong>$extension</strong> variable indicates which file extension the script will process.</p>
