<p>
    With the launch of Glass V3 we have introduced a build server, which has been kindly hosted for use by
    <a href="http://www.eduserv.org.uk">Eduserv</a>. This will allow you to download the latest Glass versions
    before they are made available on Nuget.org. 
</p>
<p>
    This server is up and running now so if you want to get Glass V3 before it is available on Nuget follow the instructions
    on our <a href="/Glass.Mapper/download.html">Download</a> page under the Pre-Release section.
</p>
<p>
    In the future we hope this will be a great way for everyone to get bug fixes and feature improvements before the are
    officially pushed to Nuget.org as stable.
