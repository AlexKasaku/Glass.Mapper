    Thanks you to all those who attended the Sitecore Virtual User Group presented by Mike Edwards
</p>
<p>
    The presentation when well with only a few Yellow Screens of Death but any demo is not complete without one. Following the 
    presentation I held a Google Hangout and thanks to everyone who attended and asked further questions. I will run more of 
    these in the future to demo more Glass features.

    The slides for the presentation are below:
