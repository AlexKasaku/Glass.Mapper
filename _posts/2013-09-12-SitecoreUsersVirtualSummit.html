    The great guys at Hedgehog Development (oh which I am now one) are holding the Sitecore Users Virtual Summit on the 15th October! Join
    me as I look at some of the more advanced features of Glass.Mapper.Sc.
</p>
<p>
    Join the Glass.Mapper.Sc session to learn about some of the ways you can extend Glass.Mapper and some of the features you may not have used.
</p>
<p>
    Currently I am thinking of covering the following topics but if you have anything specific you want to see let me know and I will see if I can fit it in.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A look at the different pipelines in Glass.Mapper and how they can be used to make development easier.</li>
    <li>The Glass.Mapper.Sc.Razor project, why and how you can use it.</li>
    <li>Using Glass.Mapper to make your code testable.</li>
    <li>Integration with third parties</li>
</ul>
