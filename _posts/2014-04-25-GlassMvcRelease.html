<p class="lead">
    Following my last blog post about <a href="2014-04-25-GlassMvc.html">Glass.Mapper.Sc and Sitecore MVC</a> I have reorganised the 
    Glass.Mapper.Sc assembly to create a MVC specific assembly. 
</p>

<p>
    Firstly a bit of background. Sitecore now supports
    3 different versions of MVC depending on the Sitecore version you are using with this being a rough guide:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Sitecore 6.x + MVC 3</li>
    <li>Sitecore 7.0-7.1 + MVC 4</li>
    <li>Sitecore 7.2 + MVC 5</li>
</ol>

<p>
    I have been packaging the MVC support for Sitecore within the Glass.Mapper.Sc assembly but this creates a problem. Glass.Mapper.Sc needs to be 
    compiled against all three MVC versions but I only have one Nuget package to distribute the assemblies in. This creates a problem because
    it isn't possible to correctly distribute the assemblies.
</p>

<p>
    The solution was to extract the Glass support for Sitecore MVC into it's own assembly and then distribute a Nuget package for each MVC framework.
    The new assembly is called Glass.Mapper.Sc.Mvc and comes in the following Nuget packages:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Glass.Mapper.Sc.Mvc-3</li>
    <li>Glass.Mapper.Sc.Mvc-4</li>
    <li>Glass.Mapper.Sc.Mvc-5</li>
</ol>
<p>
    When setting up your Sitecore project or updating an existing project you will need to download one of these Nuget packages 
    after installing Glass.Mapper.Sc v3.2+. No matter what version of the Nuget package you download the assembly 
    added to your project will be called Glass.Mapper.Sc.Mvc. I have also kept the namespaces within the assembly the same so you shouldn't need to 
    update any of your code.
</p>
<p>
    Although this is an extra step in the setup of a Glass/Sitecore solution it gives the project more flexibility and allows for 
    easier support of future MVC releases.
</p>
<p>
    This update will be released next week but for those who want to get early access and start using Glass.Mapper.Sc with MVC 5 and Sitecore 7.2 you 
    can download the packages from the Glass build server. See the download page for more information.    
</p>
<p>
    Please let me know immediately if there are any problems with the new packages.
