<p class="lead">
    Following my last blog post about <a href="2014-04-25-GlassMvc.html">Glass.Mapper.Sc and Sitecore MVC</a> I have reorganised the 
    Glass.Mapper.Sc assembly to createa  MVC specific assembly. 
</p>

<p>
    Firstly a bit of background. Sitecore are now keeping up with release of ASP.NET MVC and this now means that Sitecore works with
    3 different versions of MVC depending on the Sitecore version you are using, roughly the versioning is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Sitecore 6.x + MVC 3</li>
    <li>Sitecore 7.0-7.1 + MVC 4</li>
    <li>Sitecore 7.2 + MVC 5</li>
</ol>

<p>
    I have been packaging the MVC support for Sitecore within the Glass.Mapper.Sc assembly but this creates a problem. Glass.Mapper.Sc needs to be 
    compiled against all three MVC versions but I only have one Nuget package to distribute the assemblies in. This creates a problem because
    this just isn't possible.
</p>

<p>
    The solution was to extract the Glass support for Sitecore MVC into it's own assembly and then distribute a Nuget package for each MVC framework.
    The new assembly is called Glass.Mapper.Sc.Mvc and comes in the following Nuget packages:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Glass.Mapper.Sc.Mvc-3</li>
    <li>Glass.Mapper.Sc.Mvc-4</li>
    <li>Glass.Mapper.Sc.Mvc-5</li>
</ol>
<p>
    When setting you Sitecore projects up or updating and existing Sitecore project you will need to download one of these Nuget packages separately 
    after installing Glass.Mapper.Sc v3.2+ or Glass.Mapper.Sc.CastleWindsor. No matter what version of the Nuget package you download the assembly 
    added to your project will be called Glass.Mapper.Sc.Mvc. I have also kept the namespaces within the assembly the same so you shouldn't need to 
    update any of your code.
</p>
<p>
    Although this is an extra step in the setup of a Glass/Sitecore solution it gives the project more flexibility and allows for 
    easier support of future MVC solutions.
</p>
<p>
    This update will be released next week but for those who want to get early access and start using Glass.Mapper.Sc with MVC and Sitecore 7.2 you 
    can download the packages from the Glass build server. See the download page for more information.    
</p>
<p>
    Please let me know immediately if there are any problems with the new packages.
