    Glass.Mapper.Sc in the next release 3.1.5 you will be able to get items through the SitecoreService and SitecoreContext. Lets see how
    we can use this.

<h3>Get an Item using a Glass Service</h3>
<p>
    First off we can directly get a Sitecore item from the SitecoreService or SitecoreContext just by specifying it as the requested type:
</p>
<pre class="csharp">
    var context = new SitecoreContext();
    var item  = context.GetItem&lt;Sitecore.Data.Items.Item&gt;("/sitecore/content/home");
</pre>

<h3>Using Items on Models</h3>
<p>
    You can also specify Items to be returned on your models as well, look at the example of getting the parent and children as Items on this
    model:
</p>
<pre class="csharp">
    public class MyModel{
        
        public virtual Item Parent{ get; set; }
        public virtual IEnumerable&lt;Item&gt; Children{ get; set; }
    
    }

</pre>

<p>
    Hopefully this will allow better integration with underlying Sitecore API and a more fluid transfer from one environment to another.
