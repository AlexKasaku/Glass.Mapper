<p>
    Last week I showed you how you could reduce the amount of code you would need to write with 
    <a href="http://mikeedwards83.github.com/Glass.Mapper/2013/03/18/AutoMapping.html">Auto-Mapping</a>, however what if you 
    want to write event less configuration? How about not having to write any?
</p>
<p>
    Look at our example HomePage class below, notice that is is a pure C# object with absolutely no configuration!  
</p>

<pre class="cs" ref="gh-pages">
    public class HomePage
    {
        public virtual string Title { get; set; }
        public virtual string MainBody { get; set; }
        public virtual string Url{ get; set;}
    }
</pre>

<p>
    With this class we can now request data from the CMS:
</p>

<pre class="cs" ref="gh-pages">
    var homePage = sitecoreContext.GetCurrentItem&lt;HomePage&gt;();
</pre>

<p>
    The configuration for the classes is created the first time your request the class, afterwards the configuration is cached 
    to improve performance.
</p>
<p>
    You will need stick to the same rules defined by <a href="/Glass.Mapper/docs/concepts/automapping.html"> auto-mapping</a>, 
    and you can't use any static mapping.
